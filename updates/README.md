# Update logs
> So you can see new updates for Conjure

### Dec 6
- Going to make Shadowbyte users move to Conjure, but not yet
- Added Element (a Discord thing. I am hosting it on my laptop so it might go down sometimes)
- Added a "Featured Games" section at the top.
- Made this update log and made it public.
- Made a form from scratch but it's not public yet.
- Made the anti-chromebook lock stronger (obfuscated code and encoded password in SHA256), now you can't easily look in the code and decrypt some stuff to get it. The password does still stay the same.

Also I might add two new exploits. First one isn't very good but it's like Co-Writer. The second over is extremely strong (as soon as you exit the school wifi everything starts unbl-cking) so idk if I should make it public.
